            <h2>Target Audience Statement</h2>
            <p>
            My target audience is young adults between the ages of sixteen to twenty-two who believe identity is something they have
            full control over. This age range tends to repeat the phrase “just be yourself;” however, they don’t tend to acknowledge
            how difficult it is in reality. I chose this audience because people in this age group are beginning to form their
            identities while confronting new social pressures in work, school, etc. My overall message is that identity is not
            simply a personal choice, but something shaped by stereotypes & expectations outside one’s control. To persuade my
            intended audience, I used a relatable tone that reflects their experiences, while maintaining credibility through my
            analysis, evidence, and structure. The goal of my text is to assist my audience in understanding that authenticity is
            complicated, not because individuals are at fault, but because society restricts who you're allowed to be.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>When we grow up, we tend to hear the phrase that sounds individualistic: “just be yourself”. It’s repeated so often that
            it’s somewhat embedded into our social script, an instruction for authenticity that presumes identity is created from
            within. But as we begin to live longer, we confront this script with our own contracting experiences. People are shaped
            by the expectations placed on them & treated differently based on the categories people assume they belong in, and we’re
            pressured to behave in ways that fit our defined roles. If society truly wanted us to “be ourselves,” then why are there
            so many structures, judgments, & expectations placed on us that push us towards the roles that limit us? To develop an
            understanding of why people can’t simply exist outside of these roles, we can look at how three authors: Amy Tan, Brent
            Staples, & Gloria Anzaldúa describe these invisible forces that shape our identity. From these three authors, I’ll use
            their personal experiences to reveal that societal roles exist because they create order for those in power & make
            people easier to categorize(stereotyping). These roles can offer a rapport; however, more often than not, they restrict
            our individuality. Together, these stories will make this message clear: being yourself isn’t possible if society has
            already decided who you're supposed to be.</p>

            <h2>Amy Tan — Mother Tongue</h2>
            <p>Societal roles exist because they assist society in stereotyping individuals into specific categories; these categories
            aren’t neutral, either, they’re built on assumptions due to an individual's race, language, gender, and culture. In Amy
            Tan’s ‘’Mother Tongue,’’ we see that language can put people into roles before they can even break out of it. Tan
            elaborates on this, explaining how people treated her mother differently due to her incompetence when speaking
            English(‘’broken English’’); however, Tan was treated more seriously when she spoke on behalf of her mother. Society
            didn’t bother listening to her mother due to the role they presumptuously assigned to her, due to her limited English,
            the role of “limited English speaker” carries stereotypes of incompetence or a lack of intellectual capabilities. These
            roles don’t randomly emerge; they are formed because society prioritizes one dominant way of speaking and silences the
            others. In other words, these roles exist to maintain linguistic hierarchy and social order.</p>

            <h2>Brent Staples — Black Men in Public Spaces</h2>
            <p>Similarly, in Brent Staples’ ‘’Black Men in Public Spaces,’’ stereotypes begin to arise due to deep-rooted fears and
            racism. Staples describes how strangers treated him and assigned him the role of a dangerous Black man. Even though
            Staples described himself as a softy for simply walking through public spaces, he was assumed to be a dangerous
            individual. Staples’ notes how a woman once “They seem to set their faces on neutral and, with their purse straps strung
            across their chests bandolier style, they forge ahead as though bracing themselves against being tackled.”(Page 1,
            Paragraph 6) This woman didn’t even know Staples at all; however, due to Black men being historically viewed as vicious
            individuals capable of horrific acts of violence, she braced herself for what she assumed could happen rather than
            dropping her stereotypical beliefs, and this overpowers Staples' actual identity. This role exists due to society
            historically assigning the label of violent individuals capable of vicious acts to Black men, forming public perception.</p>

            <h2>Gloria Anzaldúa — Culture & Identity</h2>
            <p>In Gloria Azaldúa’s “How to Tame a Wild Tongue,” roles come from cultural and institutional pressure. Azaldúa elucidates
            on how Chicana women face the expectation of being able to speak “proper” English & behave acceptably, and suppress
            their culture to appear professional. Azaldúa writes that she was disciplined in school for speaking Spanish, and her
            accent was “incorrect.” This shows how institutions created and reinforced role assimilation. The role of a professional
            American student is to erase differences, and not to celebrate them. Institutions defend these roles because they
            reinforce the dominant culture and keep people under control.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Together, Tan, Azaldúa, and Staples' stories explain how socially defined roles don’t appear naturally. They exist
            because they benefit dominant groups, simplify social interactions, and maintain long-standing systems of power.
            
            Although social roles may often restrict people's individuality, they can sometimes offer identity or belonging. Tan
            acknowledges that speaking multiple versions of English provided her access to different communities. Tan wrote that her
            husband's English felt intimate. “It has become our language of intimacy, a different sort of English that relates to
            family talk”(Page 1, Paragraph 4), suggesting that a linguistic role created an intimate environment rather than
            distance. For Tan, moving between roles assisted her in understanding her spouse better and eventually empowered her to
            become a writer. This provides evidence that not all social roles are, in fact, harmful.
            
            Azaldúa also recognizes the value of shared cultural identity. Azaldúa goes on to explain how Chicano Spanish helped her
            connect to her family & history. Even though society attempted to shame her for speaking it, her linguistic role as a
            Chicana woman allowed her to preserve her culture. The good in this role comes from connectedness with her family,
            knowing that she isn’t alone in her struggle.
            
            In Staples’ case, the positive side of roles is rather complicated. Staples mentions how he started whistling popular
            melodies from Beethoven & Vivaldi during his leisurely night walks so that people felt less threatened by him(Staples).
            While this adaptation stems from unfair stereotypes, it assists Staples in navigating the world with an increased amount
            of security. In a twisted way, understanding the role others placed upon him helped him in avoiding dangerous
            misunderstandings. The benefit is survival, not acceptance.
            
            So while social roles may provide some benefit to identity & community, they’re rarely humanly designed. The “good” they
            offer tends to be accidental, while the harm they cause is more deliberate.
            
            Society claims to value individualism, but real life contradicts this idea. People can’t simply “just be themselves”
            because society judges them through expectations, and these expectations limit how we conduct ourselves, speak, and even
            how we operate in public spaces.
            
            In Tan’s experience, “being herself” meant speaking multiple English variations, but society punished her and her mother
            for it. Tan writes that she had to switch between “perfect English” in professional settings because her authentic voice
            wasn’t valued in those spaces. Tan’s authentic self wasn’t respected, only the version of herself that fit with
            society's standards.
            
            For Staples, being himself an educated & thoughtful man didn’t matter much. Society still viewed him as a dangerous
            Black man. His identity contradicted stereotypes that he never agreed to. Even though Staples did nothing wrong, he had
            to constantly adapt to situations to avoid conflict. Being himself wasn’t an option; safety forced him to perform a role
            that calmed other people's fears.
            
            For Azaldúa, “just being herself” meant embracing her mixed language and culture; however, schools, workplaces, and her
            community pressured her into changing. Azaldúa wrote, “Wild tongues can't be tamed, they can only be cut out,”(Page 2,
            Paragraph 2), meaning that society demanded assimilation and disciplined those who resisted. Authenticity becomes a
            rebellion, not a natural state.
            
            All three authors show that identity isn’t a personal choice; it’s shaped and restricted by structures that existed
            before we’re even born.
            
            Beyond individual stories, academic research also shows that socially defined roles operate as invisible rules that
            guide behavior. In the scholarly article “Organizational Citizenship Behavior: What’s Gender Got to Do With It?”
            Waismel-Manor and colleagues explain that society encourages people to conform to expectations based on their gender,
            culture, & perceived identity, even when those expectations may limit who you are as a person. They argue that people
            are often rewarded for conducting themselves in a way that aligns with stereotypes and are penalized when they violate
            them, which mirrors the experiences of Tan, Staples, & Azaldúa (Waismel-Manor et al.). This research is supportive of
            the idea that social roles don’t simply appear; they’re enforced through institutions, workplaces, and day-to-day
            interactions, making it difficult for individuals to freely express themselves authentically.
            
            Socially defined roles exist because society depends on them to keep the population in order and simplify human
            complexity. These roles can sometimes create a connected, flourishing community or protect people from
            misunderstandings, but they often have limitations when it comes to individuality and silence the parts of our identity
            that don’t conform to these expectations. Tan reveals how language determines whose words are deemed valuable and get
            listened to. Staples reveals how race dictates people's perception and treatment of you. Anzaldúa exposes how cultural
            and institutional pressure strips people of their own authentic selves. Even the research shows that these expectations
            aren’t random; systems reward following stereotypes and punish them when they step outside of the roles that society
            assigns, which makes genuine self-expression even more difficult. Together, they prove that telling someone to “just be
            yourself” ignores the realities of identity in a world where roles are reinforced through institutions, power, and
            predetermined stereotypes from history. Authenticity is not a simple act; it’s a negotiation with forces larger than us.
            Understanding these forces is the first step towards challenging them, and toward creating a world where being authentic
            is actually possible.</p>
